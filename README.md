# Pytorch Quant Finance: Pytorch based Quant Finance Library

## Table of contents

## Introduction


The library is structured along three tiers:

1. **Foundational methods**.
Core mathematical methods - optimisation, interpolation, root finders,
linear algebra, random and quasi-random number generation, etc.

2. **Mid-level methods**.
ODE & PDE solvers, Ito process framework, Diffusion Path Generators,
Copula samplers etc.

3. **Pricing methods and other quant finance specific utilities**.
Specific Pricing models (e.g Local Vol (LV), Stochastic Vol (SV),
Stochastic Local Vol (SLV), Hull-White (HW)) and their calibration.
Rate curve building, payoff descriptions and schedule generation.

We aim for the library components to be easily accessible at each level. Each
layer will be accompanied by many examples which can be run independently of
higher level components.
